/*
 * Demo for showing use of the managed MQTT API.
 *
 * The example shown below uses this API to create MQTT messages and
 * send them over the connection established using FreeRTOS sockets.
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory;
 *
 * !!! NOTE !!!
 * This MQTT demo does not authenticate the server nor the client.
 * Hence, this demo should not be used as production ready code.
 *
 * Also see https://www.freertos.org/mqtt/mqtt-agent-demo.html? for an
 * alternative run time model whereby coreMQTT runs in an autonomous
 * background agent task.  Executing the MQTT protocol in an agent task
 * removes the need for the application writer to explicitly manage any MQTT
 * state or call the MQTT_ProcessLoop() API function. Using an agent task
 * also enables multiple application tasks to more easily share a single
 * MQTT connection.
